# Honorous NFT frontend

### $GLORY Dashboard

- Give user summary of their wallet status
- Countdown to end of Leaderboard Competition
- Qualify this week for Lootbox?
- Lootbox next claim
- How many people are currently qualified
- Claim/Stake tokens
- Table based leaderboard , field values (reverse sorted by Total $GLORY)
- Total Battles competed (Secondary)

### Battle Page

- See which NFT you have that are available for staking
- Choose NFT you would like to submit
- Claim/Stake tokens
- Return NFT

### NFT Staking

- Claim function will be disabled until battle is done, but you can stake/burn the tokens during the battle (‘apply’=stake or burn)
- Can be minimized by checking MagicEden listings (interaction with contract, interaction transaction)
- Then the whole wallet is removed from the battle (demoted to cadet)
- They can switch wallets and stake again, but they would miss out on earnings
